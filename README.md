# Savr. 🍽️💚

**Savr** (*pronounced Savour*) is a web platform designed to **bridge the gap between restaurants with surplus food and NGOs dedicated to feeding the hungry**.  

Our mission is simple yet impactful: **reduce food waste and fight hunger** by creating a **seamless, trustworthy, and scalable donation pipeline**.
