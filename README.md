# Savr 🍽️💚

**Savr** (pronounced *Savour*) is a web platform designed to bridge the gap between restaurants with surplus food and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) dedicated to feeding the hungry. Our mission is to reduce food waste and fight hunger by creating a simple, efficient, and reliable donation pipeline.
