# Savr 🍽️💚
## Turn Surplus into Support.

Savr is a web platform designed to bridge the gap between restaurants with surplus food and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) dedicated to feeding the hungry. Our mission is to reduce food waste and fight hunger by creating a simple, efficient, and reliable donation pipeline.
